    <h1>How the game works</h1>
    <p>In HoA there are 2 team of 3 players, to win you must destroy the opposing teams nexus.</p>
    <p>Start out by picking one of the 3 classes, kill minions to gain xp which you can spend xp on new abilities and upgrading your stats.</p>
    <p>Players divide themselves between 2 lanes, the team consists of a top laner, bottom laner, and a roaming/jungler.
      Each laner stays in their lane for most of the early to mid game while the jungler supports whatever lane needs help.</p>
    <p>As the game goes on players will take abilities to add to their arsenal,
      for example a Templar could take an ice wall that is used to block off an entrance to an area stopping the enemy team from rotating,
      or a Warrior could take an ability that gives them life steal for a little bit keeping them alive while they are up in the opponents face</p>
